# Create a class SET. Create member functions to perform the following SET
# operations:
# 1) ismember: check whether an element belongs to the set or not and return value
# as true/false.
# 2) powerset: list all the elements of the power set of a set .
# 3) subset: Check whether one set is a subset of the other or not.
# 4) union and Intersection of two Sets.
# 5) complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user.
# 6) set Difference and Symmetric Difference between two sets.
# 7) cartesian Product of Sets.
# Write a menu driven program to perform the above functions on an instance of the
# SET class.
