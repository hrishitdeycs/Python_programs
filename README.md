# Computation
A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined. Common examples of computation are mathematical equation solving and the execution of computer algorithms.
# Hardware
Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of an analog or digital computer. The term hardware distinguishes the tangible aspects of a computing device from software, which consists of written, machine-readable instructions or programs that tell physical components what to do and when to execute the instructions.
# Storage
Storage is frequently used to describe devices that connect to a computer -- either directly or over a network -- and that support the transfer of data through input/output (I/O) operations. Storage devices can include hard disk drives (HDDs), flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs), optical disc drives, tape systems and other media types.
# Front end 
Front-end development focuses on creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web application that users interact with directly.
# Back end
Back-end development focuses on the server-side of web applications, handling everything that users don’t see but is crucial for the website’s functionality. This includes working with databases, server logic, APIs, and ensuring the overall performance and security of the application.
# NIC
A network interface card, also known as NIC or network interface controller, is typically a circuit board installed on the computer to connect to the network. It works as an indispensable component for the network connection of computers. Currently, NIC cards designed as a built-in style are commonly found in most computers and some network servers. Besides, NIC cards like server NICs can also be inserted into expansion slots of devices.
# Ethernet
Ethernet is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN). It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3

Networks allow for the efficient exchange of data, enabling various applications such as email, file sharing, and internet browsing.
# Operating system
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.
# Cloud
"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
# OSI
OSI model is a 7-layer framework for network communication developed by ISO in 1984. Learn the functions, features, and examples of each layer, and how data flows through the OSI model from sender to receiver. 
# Application
App is short for "application," which is the same thing as a software program. While an app may refer to a program for any hardware platform, it is most often used to describe programs for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.
# Virtual Machine
A virtual machine also known as a Virtual Machine is defined as a computer resource that functions like a physical computer and makes use of software resources only instead of using any physical computer for functioning, running programs, and deploying the apps. While using Virtual Machine the experience of end-user is the same as that of when using a physical device.
# Bare metal
A bare metal system is a computer that does not include any software. This means the user must install an operating system in order for the hardware to be functional.
# Kernal
A kernel is the foundational layer of an operating system (OS). It functions at a basic level, communicating with hardware and managing resources, such as RAM and the CPU.
# VPN
A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a safe and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the Internet. A Virtual Private Network is a way to extend a private network using a public network such as the Internet. The name only suggests that it is a “Virtual Private Network”, i.e. user can be part of a local network sitting at a remote location. It makes use of tuneling protocols to establish a secure connection.
# DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
# IP
All the computers of the world on the Internet network communicate with each other with underground or underwater cables or wirelessly. If I want to download a file from the internet or load a web page or literally do anything related to the internet, my computer must have an address so that other computers can find and locate mine in order to deliver that particular file or webpage that I am requesting. In technical terms, that address is called IP Address or Internet Protocol Address.
# OS
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
# Architecture 
Computer architecture is the arrangement of the components that comprise a computer system and the engine at the core of the processes that drive its functioning. It specifies the machine interface for which programming languages and associated processors are designed.ture
# DSA
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and the design of procedures (algorithms) for solving problems, which operate on these data structures. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant, including companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook (now Meta).
# DBMS
A database management system (DBMS) is a software system for creating and managing databases. A DBMS enables end users to create, protect, read, update and delete data in a database. It also manages security, data integrity and concurrency for databases.
# Algorithm
A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
# Compiler
A compiler typically works through several stages to transform source code into executable machine code. These stages include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. During lexical analysis, the compiler breaks down the code into tokens, such as keywords and operators.
# Interpreter
An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language, without converting it into machine code. In programming, we can execute a program in two ways. Firstly, through compilation and secondly, through an interpreter. The common way is to use a compiler.
# Data structure
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program.
# Semiconductors
A Semiconductor is a kind of material that performs conductivity between conductors and insulators and has a conductivity value that lies between the conductor and an insulator.
# API
API full form is an Application Programming Interface that is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them. A programmer can make use of various API tools to make their program easier and simpler. Also, an API facilitates programmers with an efficient way to develop their software programs. Thus api meaning is when an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with the necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user.
# Protocol
In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.
# DevOps
DevOps is a software development approach emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to provide high-quality products to customers quickly and efficiently. 
# Router
A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
# Hub
Hub in networking plays a vital role in data transmission and broadcasting. A hub is a hardware device used at the physical layer to connect multiple devices in the network. Hubs are widely used to connect LANs. A hub has multiple ports. Unlike a switch, a hub cannot filter the data, i.e. it cannot identify the destination of the packet, So it broadcasts or sends the message to each port.
# RISC
The main idea behind this is to simplify hardware by using an instruction set composed of a few basic steps for loading, evaluating, and storing operations just like a load command will load data, a store command will store the data. 
# CISC
The main idea is that a single instruction will do all loading, evaluating, and storing operations just like a multiplication command will do stuff like loading data, evaluating, and storing it, hence it’s complex. 
# Data mining
Data mining is the process of searching and analyzing a large batch of raw data in order to identify patterns and extract useful information.
Companies use data mining software to learn more about their customers. It can help them to develop more effective marketing strategies, increase sales, and decrease costs. Data mining relies on effective data collection, warehousing, and computer processing.
# Git
Git is a widely used distributed version control and source code management system. It effectively tracks changes to source code, enabling effortless branching, merging, and versioning.
# Flutter
Flutter is a UI toolkit made by Google for developing cross-platform apps. Flutter supports Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Mac. It’s a free and open-source toolkit to build visually appealing apps.
# Open source
The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs.
# Hypervisor
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software layer that enables virtualization by creating and managing virtual machines (VMs). It acts as a platform for running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine by separating the operating systems and applications from the hardware.
