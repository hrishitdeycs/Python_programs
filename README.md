# Computation
A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined. Common examples of computation are mathematical equation solving and the execution of computer algorithms.
# Hardware
Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of an analog or digital computer. The term hardware distinguishes the tangible aspects of a computing device from software, which consists of written, machine-readable instructions or programs that tell physical components what to do and when to execute the instructions.
# Storage
Storage is frequently used to describe devices that connect to a computer -- either directly or over a network -- and that support the transfer of data through input/output (I/O) operations. Storage devices can include hard disk drives (HDDs), flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs), optical disc drives, tape systems and other media types.
# Front end 
Front-end development focuses on creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web application that users interact with directly.
# Back end
Back-end development focuses on the server-side of web applications, handling everything that users don’t see but is crucial for the website’s functionality. This includes working with databases, server logic, APIs, and ensuring the overall performance and security of the application.
