# Computation
A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined. Common examples of computation are mathematical equation solving and the execution of computer algorithms.
# Hardware
Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of an analog or digital computer. The term hardware distinguishes the tangible aspects of a computing device from software, which consists of written, machine-readable instructions or programs that tell physical components what to do and when to execute the instructions.
# Storage
Storage is frequently used to describe devices that connect to a computer -- either directly or over a network -- and that support the transfer of data through input/output (I/O) operations. Storage devices can include hard disk drives (HDDs), flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs), optical disc drives, tape systems and other media types.
# Front end 
Front-end development focuses on creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web application that users interact with directly.
# Back end
Back-end development focuses on the server-side of web applications, handling everything that users don’t see but is crucial for the website’s functionality. This includes working with databases, server logic, APIs, and ensuring the overall performance and security of the application.
# NIC
A network interface card, also known as NIC or network interface controller, is typically a circuit board installed on the computer to connect to the network. It works as an indispensable component for the network connection of computers. Currently, NIC cards designed as a built-in style are commonly found in most computers and some network servers. Besides, NIC cards like server NICs can also be inserted into expansion slots of devices.
# Ethernet
Ethernet is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN). It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3
# Network
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and information. These devices can include computers, servers, printers, and other hardware. Networks allow for the efficient exchange of data, enabling various applications such as email, file sharing, and internet browsing.
# Operating system
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.
# Cloud
"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
# OSI
OSI model is a 7-layer framework for network communication developed by ISO in 1984. Learn the functions, features, and examples of each layer, and how data flows through the OSI model from sender to receiver. 
# Application
App is short for "application," which is the same thing as a software program. While an app may refer to a program for any hardware platform, it is most often used to describe programs for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.
# Virtual Machine
A virtual machine also known as a Virtual Machine is defined as a computer resource that functions like a physical computer and makes use of software resources only instead of using any physical computer for functioning, running programs, and deploying the apps. While using Virtual Machine the experience of end-user is the same as that of when using a physical device.
# Bare metal
A bare metal system is a computer that does not include any software. This means the user must install an operating system in order for the hardware to be functional.
# Kernal
A kernel is the foundational layer of an operating system (OS). It functions at a basic level, communicating with hardware and managing resources, such as RAM and the CPU.
